ðŸŽ‰ xk6-sql `v1.0.0` is here!

## Modularization

This release contains a major refactoring, the modularization of the previously monolithic `xk6-sql`. The database driver integrations have been extracted into separate k6 driver extensions.

Although modularization means a small API modification, it is basically a **breaking change!**

## How it Works

The SQL database driver integration is implemented in a separate k6 extension. The JavaScript API of this extension contains a single default export whose type is [JavaScript Symbol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol) and is used to specify the database driver in the [xk6-sql API](https://sql.x.k6.io).

The use of the Symbol type is necessary in order to force the import of the driver module.

```JavaScript
import sql from "k6/x/sql"
import sqlite3 from "k6/x/sql/sqlite3"

const db = sql.open(sqlite3, "./test.db")
```

## Drivers

For easier discovery, the `xk6-sql-driver` topic is included in the database driver extensions repository. The [xk6-sql-driver GitHub topic search](https://github.com/topics/xk6-sql-driver) therefore lists the available driver extensions.

During the refactoring, the following k6 SQL database driver extensions were created from the database drivers previously embedded in the xk6-sql extension:

- https://github.com/grafana/xk6-sql-driver-mysql
- https://github.com/grafana/xk6-sql-driver-postgres
- https://github.com/grafana/xk6-sql-driver-sqlite3
- https://github.com/grafana/xk6-sql-driver-azuresql
- https://github.com/grafana/xk6-sql-driver-sqlserver
- https://github.com/grafana/xk6-sql-driver-clickhouse

The following template repository can be used to create a new driver extension: https://github.com/grafana/xk6-sql-driver-ramsql

## Solved problems

1. New SQL database type support (integration of new golang database/sql driver) does not require changes to the source code of `xk6-sql` and the release of `xk6-sql`.

2. Supporting additional database drivers does not increase the size of `k6`. Since the database drivers are implemented in a separate `k6` extension, it is sufficient to embed only the drivers you want to use.

3. The SQL database driver integration created by the community can be maintained by the community. Since database drivers are implemented as `k6` extensions, the community can create and maintain driver modules independently of Grafana.

4. Drivers may have different requirements. For example, cgo (`CGO_ENABLED`) should only be enabled if a driver needs it. (like `sqlite3`).

5. From the security perspective, the attack surface is smaller if fewer dependencies are embedded.

## Build

The [xk6](https://github.com/grafana/xk6) build tool can be used to build a k6 that will include **xk6-sql** extension **and database drivers**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In the command line bellow, **xk6-sql-driver-ramsql** is just an example, it should be replaced with the database driver extension you want to use.
> For example use `--with github.com/grafana/xk6-sql-driver-mysql` to access MySQL databases.

```bash
xk6 build --with github.com/grafana/xk6-sql@latest --with github.com/grafana/xk6-sql-driver-ramsql@latest
```

## API Compatibility

The `xk6-sql` JavaScript API changes in an incompatible way because of the driver parameter type becomes Symbol instead of String.

## API documentation

A TypeScript declaration file was created for the `xk6-sql` API, from which an [API documentation site](https://sql.x.k6.io) is generated.

## MySQL TLS support

MySQL TLS configuration support has been moved to the driver extension: https://github.com/grafana/xk6-sql-driver-mysql

It is important to note that the MySQL TLS configuration API will change in the future.
