xk6-sql `v1.0.3` is here ðŸŽ‰!

This release includes:

Bugfixes:

- [Symbol type driver parameter support](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-sql/issues/120): The `open()` function now accepts `Symbol` (class) type driver ids in addition to the primitive symbol type. This is because when a driver is imported with the `require()` function, it is not a primitive symbol that is imported, but a `Symbol` class type. Also fixes [#115](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-sql/issues/115)
