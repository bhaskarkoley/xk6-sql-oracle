xk6-sql `v1.0.4` is here ðŸŽ‰!

This release includes:

## New features

- [Timeout support in `execWithTimeout()` and `queryWithTimeout()` functions](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-sql/issues/127): The `exec()` and `query()` functions wait for an unlimited amount of time for the result. This can lead to the test stalling, for example, in the event of a network problem. The API has been extended with timeout-handling counterparts of these functions: `execWithTimeout()` and `queryWithTimeout()`. The first parameter is the timeout. The timeout parameter is a duration string, a possibly signed sequence of decimal numbers, each with optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as `300ms`, `-1.5h` or `2h45m`. Valid time units are `ns`, `us` (or `Âµs`), `ms`, `s`, `m`, `h`.

## Bugfixes

- [Use VU Context()](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-sql/issues/124): VU Context() is now used in `query()` and `exec()` functions instead of background context. Using background context is a potential problem if SQL operations are still running after the VU context is invalidated.
